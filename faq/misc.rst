What does `TLP` stand for?
--------------------------
TLP is not an acronym, it's just a three-letter name.

Features excluded from TLP intentionally
----------------------------------------
* Backlight brightness: this would conflict with existing desktop functionality
  such as the GNOME power manager
* Fan Control: third party tools exist, `thinkfan <http://thinkfan.sourceforge.net/>`_
  for example
* Custom/user specific scripts: not available for support reasons.
* ThinkPad battery balancing i.e. selecting the active battery: the Lenovo firmware
  offers no way to do this, neither manual nor automatic
* Undervolting for Intel Core i CPUs: there's plenty of third party tools
