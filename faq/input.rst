Input Devices
=============

Why does TLP cause my USB keyboard or mouse to stop working?
------------------------------------------------------------
Most likely it doesn't. All USB input devices (driver `usbhid`) are excluded
from autosuspend by default.

Refer to :ref:`set-usb-blacklist`.

Bluetooth mouse stops or disconnects
------------------------------------
Refer to :ref:`faq-bluetooth-unstable`.
