20.12.2021 - TLP 1.5 Beta 1 released
====================================
In preparation for the next feature release today I publish the first beta of
TLP 1.5. The following features are included:

* Charge threshold support for Sony laptops
* Preparation for the upcoming kernel interface for recalibration of ThinkPad
  batteries, which will make the external kernel module *acpi_call* obsolete
* Support for switching NFC devices (new command :command:`nfc on|off`)

For a quick glance check the `release notes <https://github.com/linrunner/TLP/releases>`_
or see the `changelog <https://github.com/linrunner/TLP/blob/main/changelog>`_
for details on features and bugfixes.

As with every upcoming release I need help to complete the test coverage. So I'm
reaching out to the community of Linux users to test new and existing
functionality on their hardware.

Check the `beta page <https://download.linrunner.de/packages/>`_
for instructions and packages matching your distribution - then join
the testers.
