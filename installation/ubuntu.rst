Ubuntu
======
.. rubric:: Scope:

* Officially supported Ubuntu releases
* Corresponding Linux Mint releases *but not* LMDE – refer to
  :doc:`debian` instead

Package Repository
------------------
Add the `TLP PPA`_ to your package sources with the commands: ::

   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:linrunner/tlp
   sudo apt update

.. note::

   TLP and ThinkPad-related packages below are available via the official Ubuntu
   repository. Nevertheless it is recommended to use the `TLP PPA`_ to stay with the
   latest TLP version.

Package Installation
--------------------
Install the packages

* **tlp** *(PPA or universe)* – Power saving
* **tlp-rdw** *(PPA or universe)* – optional – :doc:`/settings/rdw`

either with your favorite package manager or the command: ::

    sudo apt install tlp tlp-rdw

*Version 1.5 only*: due to a bug in the Ubuntu packages (official and PPA)
it is necessary to enable the service manually after installation: ::

    sudo systemctl enable tlp.service

The problem is resolved for version 1.6.

Legacy ThinkPads only: External Kernel Module for Battery Care
--------------------------------------------------------------
.. important::

    As of version 5.17, the Linux kernel in combination with TLP 1.5 or later
    offers full battery care support (i.e. charge thresholds and recalibration)
    for ThinkPads from model year 2011 onwards. Ubuntu 23.10 and 24.04 meet this
    requirement, 22.04 can be upgraded to the 6.8 kernel (HWE)
    from the official repositories.

    **An external kernel module (also referred to as an "out-of-tree" module)
    is not required in these cases, and the following steps are not necessary.
    However, if your model is from 2011 or older, read on.**

Only if the bottom of the output of :command:`tlp-stat -b`, section 'Recommendations',
shows the line

.. code-block:: none

    Install tp-smapi kernel modules for ThinkPad battery thresholds and recalibration

then install the required package

* **tp-smapi-dkms** *(main)* – optional – External kernel module providing
  battery charge thresholds and recalibration for ThinkPads before model year 2011
  as well as specific :command:`tlp-stat -b` output until model year 2011

either with your favorite package manager or the command ::

    apt install tp-smapi-dkms

.. warning::

    In *Ubuntu 23.10* and *24.04* the `tp-smapi-dkms` package from the official
    repositories is currently broken and does neither build nor install the kernel module.

    Workaround: download the working package from
    `Debian Sid <https://packages.debian.org/sid/all/tp-smapi-dkms/download>`_
    and install manually ::

        wget -P /tmp http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/pool/main/t/tp-smapi/tp-smapi-dkms_0.44-1_all.deb
        sudo apt install /tmp/tp-smapi-dkms_0.44-1_all.deb
