.. important::

    All input devices (driver `usbhid`) and [as of version 1.2] `libsane`-supported
    scanners get excluded by default. It's therefore unnecessary to put them on
    the :ref:`set-usb-blacklist`. To circumvent the default for certain devices
    enter the IDs into :ref:`set-usb-whitelist`.
