    As of version 4.19, the mainline kernel includes charge threshold
    functionality for ThinkPads from model year 2011 onwards. If this is
    sufficient for you, no external kernel modules are required and you do not
    need to proceed any further here.

    However, if you need the recalibration feature or your model and/or kernel
    is older, read on.
