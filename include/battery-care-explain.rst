*In Version 1.3 and below it is called "Battery Features".*

The purpose of `Battery Care` on laptops is to reduce the loss of capacity due
to wear from ongoing battery operation i.e. to prolongate the `battery lifespan`.
This can be achieved by:

1. Limiting the maximum charge level to below 100%: *stop charge threshold*
2. After a short discharge, prevent the charging process from continuing as
   soon as the charger is connected: *start charge threshold*
3. *Recalibration*: helps keeping charge level (SOC) readings and
   battery runtime estimates accurate by setting new "full charge" and
   "full discharge" anchors in the battery controller

Battery Care does *not* comprise additional power saving.
