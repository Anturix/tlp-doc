TLP
###
TLP is a feature-rich command line utility for Linux, saving laptop battery power
without the need to delve deeper into technical details.

TLP’s default settings are already optimized for battery life and implement
Powertop’s recommendations out of the box. So you may just install and forget it.
Nevertheless TLP is highly customizable to fulfil your
specific requirements.
