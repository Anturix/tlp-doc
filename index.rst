    TLP is a feature-rich command line utility for Linux, **saving laptop
    battery power**  without the need to delve deeper into technical details.

    TLP’s default settings are already **optimized for battery life** and
    implement Powertop’s recommendations out of the box. So you may just
    **install and forget** it.

    Nevertheless TLP is **highly customizable** to fulfil your
    specific requirements.
